# Universal Character Replacer
The Universal Character Replacer is a tool for replacing characters in text files according to a specified mapping file. The mapping file can be used to replace specific characters, fix typos, or even convert between different character encodings.

## Getting Started
1. Download the latest release of Universal Character Replacer from the [Releases](https://github.com/ellipszist/UCR/releases/latest) page on GitHub.
2. Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file.
3. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you extracted the files.
4. Run the program by typing `universal_character_replacer.exe` and pressing enter.
5. You will be prompted to select the input directory, which is the directory containing the text files you want to replace characters in.
6. You will also be prompted to select the output directory, which is the directory where the modified text files will be saved.
7. The program will then prompt you to select the file type, which is the file extension of the text files you want to replace characters in (e.g. "txt").
8. Finally, the program will prompt you to select the mapping file, which is a JSON file containing the character mappings.
9. The program will then process all text files in the input directory and its subdirectories, and save the modified files in the output directory.
10. The program will display the total number of files processed and the number of files that failed to process.

## Example Mapping File
You can find an example mapping file in the 'Mapping/Demos' directory.
